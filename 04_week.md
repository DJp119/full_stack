# Why should we use Cloudinary?

- Deploying videos and images along with your codebase in a production environment has several drawbacks, which is why using cloud-based storage and delivery services like Cloudinary is a common and beneficial practice

- It offers scalability, performance, and cost efficiency, while avoiding issues like large codebase size, server load, and security concerns. It also provides optimization and backup features.

1. **Scalability:** When you include large video and image files within your codebase, it can significantly increase the size of your deployment package. As your application grows, this can lead to slower deployments and increased storage costs. Cloudinary and similar services are designed to handle the storage and delivery of media files efficiently and can scale to accommodate your needs.

2. **Performance:** Hosting media files on a cloud service optimized for content delivery can lead to better performance. These services often use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve files from geographically distributed servers, reducing load times for users and improving overall user experience.

3. **Reduced Load on Your Servers:** Serving media files directly from your application server can consume resources and slow down your server's responsiveness. Offloading this task to a specialized service like Cloudinary can help ensure your server remains available for more critical tasks.

4. **Image and Video Optimization:** Cloudinary and similar services offer built-in tools for image and video optimization. They can automatically resize, compress, and format media files to improve loading times while maintaining quality. Managing these optimizations in your code can be complex and time-consuming.

5. **Version Control:** Managing binary media files in version control systems like Git can lead to repository bloat, making it difficult to collaborate with others and slowing down version control operations. By using external storage and linking to media files in your code, you avoid these issues.

6. **Security:** Cloudinary provides features to control access to your media files, including authentication, encryption, and the ability to set access permissions. Storing media files in a public GitHub repository, for example, may expose them to the public, which may not be suitable for sensitive data.

7. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Cloudinary and similar services often have built-in backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure your media files are safe and accessible in the event of a failure. If you store media files on your server, you would need to implement and manage your own backup and recovery solutions.

8. **Cost Efficiency:** While cloud-based media storage services may have associated costs, they can be cost-effective when compared to self-hosting and managing large amounts of media data, especially when considering the benefits of their performance and optimization features.
